Programming Concepts Questions


In this repository, you will find basic implementation of linked list, Stacks, Queues and Hashing.

### Linked List
In Linked List, we have implemented few of basic implementations such as
1) Singly Linked List
2) Doubly Linked List
3) Circular Linked List
4) Skip List

Each Linked list have following methods such as Insertion, Deletion, Searching, and Traversing. You can refer to python code. In case you want us to implement something more than this. Kindly email us at raj.kumar2208@yahoo.in.
Would like to help other fellow, Thanks

### Stacks
In stacks, following are
1) Stack implementation based on Array (in python we have used list data structure for array implementation instead of numpy.array)
2) Stack implementation based on Dynamic Array. (here dynamic array means, we are using array doubling technique, to optimize above implementation.
3) Stack implementation based on Linked List.
